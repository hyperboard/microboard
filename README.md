# Plan for Open-Sourcing the Board Component

To open-source the Board component, we'll need to:

## Extract the Board code to a standalone library

1. Identify all files and dependencies related to the Board component
2. Create a new repository with appropriate folder structure for a component library
3. Move the relevant code while maintaining internal relationships between files

## Preserve git history from the original repository

1. Use `git filter-branch` or `git-filter-repo` to extract only the Board-related files and their history
2. This ensures all commits, authors, and timestamps are preserved for the component
3. Alternative approach: use `git subtree` if the component is in a distinct directory

## Set up proper packaging and exports

1. Configure package.json with name, version, description, and license
2. Set up main, module, and types fields to support different import methods
3. Define which files should be published via the "files" field in package.json

## Adjust imports to work with the library setup

1. Update relative imports to match the new file structure
2. Ensure named exports are consistent and well-documented
3. Consider creating barrel files (index.js) for simpler importing

## Update any internal references

1. Replace any references to internal services with configurable options
2. Create adapter interfaces for external dependencies
3. Ensure the component can work in isolation without company-specific code

## Set up proper documentation in README.md

1. Write clear installation and usage instructions
2. Document the component API, props, and configuration options
3. Include examples showing common use cases and customization
4. Add contributing guidelines and code of conduct

## Set up a CI/CD pipeline for the GitHub repo

1. Configure GitHub Actions to run tests and builds on PRs
2. Add linting and type checking to the pipeline
3. Set up automated code quality checks and test coverage reporting

## Configure npm publishing workflow

1. Create a release process for versioning and publishing
2. Set up npm automation for consistent package releases
3. Configure access tokens and permissions for secure publishing
